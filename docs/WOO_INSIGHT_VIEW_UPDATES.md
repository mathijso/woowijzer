## Data Display Logic

### Document Show Page
```php
// Processing status banner
@if($document->api_processing_status === 'processing' || 'pending')
    // Show processing banner
@elseif($document->api_processing_status === 'failed')
    // Show error banner with retry message
@elseif($document->api_processing_status === 'completed')
    // Show success banner
@endif

// Timeline events
@if($document->hasTimelineEvents())
    // Display document-specific timeline events
@endif
```

### WooRequest Show Page
```php
// Decision overview
@if($wooRequest->hasDecision())
    // Display B1 summary, reasons, and process outline
@endif

// Aggregated timeline
@if($wooRequest->hasTimeline())
    // Display all timeline events from all documents
@endif
```

---

## Backwards Compatibility

All updates are **backwards compatible**:
- Old `isProcessed()` checks still work
- New views gracefully handle missing data
- Empty states are displayed when no timeline/decision exists
- Existing functionality remains unchanged

---

## Testing Checklist

When testing the WOO Insight API integration:

- [ ] Upload a document and verify processing status updates
- [ ] Check that timeline events appear on document show page
- [ ] Verify aggregated timeline appears on WooRequest page
- [ ] Confirm decision overview displays after processing
- [ ] Test failed document retry flow
- [ ] Verify status badges display correctly in all views
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness of new sections
- [ ] Ensure error messages display properly

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Live Updates**: WebSocket integration for real-time status updates
2. **Timeline Filtering**: Filter events by type, date, or actor
3. **Export Features**: Download timeline as PDF or JSON
4. **Confidence Threshold**: Allow users to filter low-confidence events
5. **Document Comparison**: Side-by-side view of related documents
6. **Event Annotations**: Allow case managers to add notes to events

---

## Configuration

All features respect the WOO Insight API configuration in `config/woo.php`:

```php
'woo_insight_api' => [
    'base_url' => env('WOO_INSIGHT_API_URL', 'http://localhost:5000'),
    'timeout' => env('WOO_INSIGHT_API_TIMEOUT', 120),
    'retry_interval_minutes' => env('WOO_INSIGHT_RETRY_INTERVAL', 10),
]
```
